# technojam-task-web
I enjoyed a lot learning web development for the process. It really excited me that websites we use daily are coded like this

I started with udemy course referred by my friend but since the course duration was long, i made this website using youtube searching different components separately and combining them all together. 

But being a beginner I faced multiple issues, responsiveness turned out to be the first. The code that looks perfect in laptop view gets all jumbled up in mobile view.
Arranging the task using position attribute was also a difficult task but flexbox and grid reduced the pressure and gave subtle view to the website
